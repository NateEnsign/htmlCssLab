    <h2>The Last 10 Years: The Lord Requires a 10% Tithe</h2>
    <p>The Holy War is the name given to the American college football rivalry game played annually by the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars and the University of Utah (U of U) Utes.[5] It is part of the larger BYU–Utah sports rivalry. In this context, the term "Holy War" refers to the fact that BYU is owned and administered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the University of Utah is a public university with a large LDS student population.[6] The proximity of the two schools, the athletic successes of the two teams, and the longevity of the series all continue to foster the rivalry.[7]</p>

    <h2>Back and Forth W's Flames the Fire</h2>
    <p>Both teams played in the same conference from 1922 to 2010, most recently in the Western Athletic Conference and Mountain West Conference. During the Mountain West years, the Holy War was often the deciding game of the conference title. Despite Utah moving to the Pac-12 Conference in 2011 and BYU becoming an independent the same year, the two universities agreed to continue playing. The series was briefly interrupted in 2014 and 2015 for Utah to play a home-and-home series with Michigan — the first since 1943 to 1945, when BYU did not field a team due to World War II.[8] Games have since been scheduled until 2028—with another interruption in 2022 and 2023 for Utah to play a home series with Florida.</p>

    <h2>Lavell Brings a Sliver of Respect to a Deadbeat Program: (Delusional BYU Fans Emerge and Breed like Rabbits)</h2>
    <p>The University of Deseret was established February 28, 1850 by the General Assembly of the provisional State of Deseret. This date is enshrined on the seal of the U of U. The University of Deseret closed in 1853 and was reestablished in 1867. In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, to coincide with Utah's first football team. The team had won 1 game and lost 2 in their first campaign, including a loss to future rival Utah State. The U of U was controlled by the LDS Church from its founding until well after Statehood in 1896.</p>
